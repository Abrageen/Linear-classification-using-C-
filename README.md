# Linear-classification-using-C++
I made this Linear classification without using any advanced python libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch to show my knowledge base in AI.
It has a class called 'forward propagation' which takes the input and passes it through the model.
It has a class called 'backward propagation' which calculates the loss function when training.
It also has a class called 'optimise' which uses the loss function and performs Gradient descent algorithm on the model.
It doesnt use any advanced libraries except the basic C++ ones such as 'stdio.h' and 'math.h to perform basic input/output as well as mathematical functions respectively.
